/**
 * Stores users in a {@link Map}, keyed by email.
 *
 * <p><b>This class is temporary and that is the point.</b> Day-03 replaces it
 * with a PostgreSQL-backed repository. Writing it now, deliberately, buys one
 * thing: every layer above can be built and tested against a working store
 * before any JDBC, any Hibernate, any SQL exists. When Day-03 swaps the
 * implementation, the service and controller should not need a single edit. If
 * they do, the boundary was drawn in the wrong place — and finding that out is
 * cheaper today than after the database is wired in.
 *
 * <p>Notice what this class does <em>not</em> do: it does not validate, it does
 * not hash, it does not decide policy. A repository answers "what is stored?" and
 * nothing else. The duplicate check here is the one judgement call, and it lives
 * here only because uniqueness is a property of the collection — see
 * {@link DuplicateEmailException}.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Repository} does two things. The obvious one: it makes this class a
 * bean, so Spring builds it at startup and hands it to whoever asks. The one worth
 * remembering: it switches on <b>exception translation</b>. From Day-03, a
 * vendor-specific {@code PSQLException} thrown inside here is caught and rethrown
 * as Spring's {@code DataAccessException} before it leaves the class. That is why
 * the annotation is not interchangeable with {@code @Service} even though both
 * merely "make a bean" — swap it and the service layer starts importing
 * {@code org.postgresql}, and the layer whose whole job is not knowing where data
 * lives would then name the vendor.
 *
 * <p>Note that today, in memory, that translation protects nothing. The annotation
 * is correct now and load-bearing later, and the failure from getting it wrong
 * would not appear until Day-03 — which is precisely why it is easy to get wrong.

     * <p>Why a {@code Map} and not a {@code List}: finding a user by email in a
     * list means walking every element, and the cost grows with the number of
     * users. A hash map goes more or less straight to the entry regardless of
     * size. That difference is invisible with three users and decisive with three
     * million, and it is the same mechanism described in {@link User#hashCode()} —
     * hash to a bucket, then compare within it.
     *
     * <p>{@code ConcurrentHashMap} rather than {@code HashMap} because a web
     * application is multi-threaded from its very first request: Tomcat handles
     * each request on its own thread, all sharing this one object. A plain
     * {@code HashMap} written to by two threads at once can corrupt its internal
     * structure — not merely lose an update, but genuinely break. This does not
     * make the look-then-insert in {@link #save} atomic; nothing about the map
     * choice fixes that. It only prevents the map itself from being damaged.
