/**
 * What the application can ask of user storage — and nothing about how.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this interface appears today and not on Day-01.</b> The package
 * documentation has claimed since slice 4 that swapping the store would not
 * change the service. That was not quite true: {@code UserService} held a field
 * of type {@code InMemoryUserRepository}, the concrete class. It named the
 * implementation, so switching to PostgreSQL would have meant editing it.
 *
 * <p>Extracting the interface now, at the exact moment a second implementation
 * exists, is the honest sequence. Writing it on Day-01 would have been an
 * interface with one implementation — a prediction. Today it is a fact: there
 * are two, and something has to describe what they have in common.
 *
 * <p>This is also where Day-00's lesson lands for real. {@code UserService}
 * depends on this type; Spring injects whichever bean implements it. The service
 * cannot tell the difference, because there is no method here that could reveal
 * it — no {@code getConnection}, no {@code getMap}. <b>An interface is a
 * vocabulary, and a caller can only say what the vocabulary allows.</b>
 *
 * <p>Note what the method names do NOT contain: no {@code select}, no
 * {@code query}, no {@code row}. {@code findByEmail} is a question about users,
 * not about tables. If SQL vocabulary leaked into these names, the abstraction
 * would be a wrapper around a database rather than a description of storage —
 * and a {@code findAllWhereClause(String sql)} would make the in-memory
 * implementation impossible to write.

     * returned object is the only place those values exist. The in-memory version
     * returned its argument unchanged, which made the signature look like
     * ceremony. It was not; it was the signature the real implementation needs.
