/**
 * What the application can ask of user storage — and nothing about how.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this interface appears today and not on Day-01.</b> The package
 * documentation has claimed since slice 4 that swapping the store would not
 * change the service. That was not quite true: {@code UserService} held a field
 * of type {@code InMemoryUserRepository}, the concrete class. It named the
 * implementation, so switching to PostgreSQL would have meant editing it.
 *
 * <p>Extracting the interface now, at the exact moment a second implementation
 * exists, is the honest sequence. Writing it on Day-01 would have been an
 * interface with one implementation — a prediction. Today it is a fact: there
 * are two, and something has to describe what they have in common.
 *
 * <p>This is also where Day-00's lesson lands for real. {@code UserService}
 * depends on this type; Spring injects whichever bean implements it. The service
 * cannot tell the difference, because there is no method here that could reveal
 * it — no {@code getConnection}, no {@code getMap}. <b>An interface is a
 * vocabulary, and a caller can only say what the vocabulary allows.</b>
 *
 * <p>Note what the method names do NOT contain: no {@code select}, no
 * {@code query}, no {@code row}. {@code findByEmail} is a question about users,
 * not about tables. If SQL vocabulary leaked into these names, the abstraction
 * would be a wrapper around a database rather than a description of storage —
 * and a {@code findAllWhereClause(String sql)} would make the in-memory
 * implementation impossible to write.

    /**

     *
     * <p>Returns rather than {@code void}, and Day-03 is where that stops looking
     * pointless: the database generates {@code id} and {@code created_at}, so the
     * returned object is the only place those values exist. The in-memory version
     * returned its argument unchanged, which made the signature look like
     * ceremony. It was not; it was the signature the real implementation needs.

    /**
     * Persists changes to a user that already exists. <b>Day-05.</b>
     *
     * <p><b>Why this is not {@link #save}.</b> The obvious move when
     * {@code updateProfile} was written was to call {@code save} again, and it
     * failed immediately and correctly: {@code save} means <em>insert</em>, and
     * every implementation of it rejects an email that is already taken. That is
     * not a limitation to work around — it is the duplicate-signup guarantee,
     * and making {@code save} quietly become an upsert would have deleted it.
     *
     * <p>The two operations answer different questions. {@code save} asks "may
     * this person exist?" and the answer can be no. {@code update} asks "record
     * that this existing person changed", where a missing row is a programming
     * error rather than a business outcome — so it throws
     * {@link com.persona.exception.UserNotFoundException} rather than returning
     * an {@code Optional}.
     *
     * <p><b>Under JPA this method has almost nothing to do.</b> Inside a
     * transaction the entity is managed, so the setters have already scheduled
     * the UPDATE through dirty checking and the implementation only needs to
     * return the object. It exists for the JDBC implementation, which has no
     * persistence context and would otherwise silently lose the edit. Keeping
     * both implementations behind one interface costs exactly this: a method
     * that is real work on one side and a formality on the other.
