/**
 * The third implementation of {@link UserRepository}, and the point of the day.
 *
 * <pre>
 *         UserService  --depends on-->  UserRepository   (six methods)
 *                                             ^
 *              +------------------------------+------------------------------+
 *      InMemoryUserRepository         JdbcUserRepository          JpaUserRepository
 *          @Profile("test")            @Profile("jdbc")            @Profile("jpa")
 *            Day-00 slice 4                 Day-03                     Day-04
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code UserService} does not change by a single line, and neither does
 * {@code UserServiceTest}, which still builds the service with plain {@code new}
 * and no Spring context in about eleven milliseconds. That is the interface
 * extracted on Day-03 "at the exact moment a second implementation existed"
 * finally being paid for: swapping the entire persistence mechanism touches zero
 * lines of business logic.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link JdbcUserRepository} is deliberately NOT deleted.</b> It works, it
 * is tested, and keeping two real implementations side by side is what makes the
 * comparison legible — the hand-written SQL is still there to read next to the
 * version that generates it.
 *
 * <h2>The profile scheme had to change, and that is a lesson in itself</h2>
 *
 * <p>Before today: {@code InMemoryUserRepository} was {@code @Profile("test")}
 * and {@code JdbcUserRepository} was {@code @Profile("!test")}. Two
 * implementations, one boolean, and "not test" was a perfectly good way to say
 * "the real one" — while there was only one real one.
 *
 * <p>Adding a third breaks that immediately. A JPA bean with no profile, or the
 * JDBC one still claiming everything that is not test, means TWO candidates
 * outside tests and the application fails at startup with
 * {@code NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException}. Which is the good outcome — it is
 * Day-03's {@code NoSuchBeanDefinitionException} from the other direction, and it
 * fails at startup rather than at the first request.
 *
 * <p>So the negation is gone and all three now name themselves positively:
 * {@code test}, {@code jdbc}, {@code jpa}. <b>{@code @Profile("!x")} encodes an
 * assumption about how many alternatives will ever exist</b>, and it is wrong the
 * first time a third one arrives.
 *
 * <h2>What this class exists to do</h2>
 *
 * <p>It adapts {@link SpringDataUserRepository} (JPA vocabulary) to
 * {@link UserRepository} (the application's vocabulary), and translates
 * persistence exceptions into this application's own — the same job the
 * {@code @Repository} annotation describes and the same translation
 * {@link JdbcUserRepository} performs for {@code DuplicateKeyException}.
 *
 * <p>The delegation is thin on purpose. Every method here is one line plus,
 * where it matters, one decision.

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     *
     * <p><b>Why the catch is still here, and why it is subtler than Day-03's.</b>
     * {@code UserService.register()} already checks for a duplicate before
     * calling this. That check is a policy with a gap — two concurrent requests
     * can both read "not taken" before either writes — so the UNIQUE constraint
     * remains the only real guarantee, exactly as V1's comment says.
     *
     * <p>What JPA changes is WHEN the violation arrives. Under JDBC the INSERT
     * was sent by this line and the exception came from this line. Under JPA,
     * {@code save()} may only queue the insert; Hibernate flushes at commit, or
     * before a query that could be affected. So the constraint violation can
     * surface from a completely different line — often from the framework as the
     * transaction commits, after this method has returned successfully.
     *
     * <p>This catch therefore handles the case where a flush happens to occur
     * here, and cannot handle the case where it does not. That is not a bug to be
     * fixed by catching harder; it is the shape of the boundary. <b>Day-03 put it
     * as: "handled" means two different things on the two sides of it.</b> Once
     * PostgreSQL rejects a statement the whole transaction is poisoned — SQL state
     * 25P02, which this project has already met — and the only correct response is
     * to let it roll back. Catching and continuing inside a dead transaction
     * produces the 25P02 error one layer later, wearing a disguise.

            //
            //   1. The transaction is already poisoned. PostgreSQL refuses every
            //      subsequent statement until rollback — SQL state 25P02, met on
            //      Day-03. A SELECT here cannot work.
            //   2. Any query here triggers an AUTO-FLUSH first, and the failed
            //      entity is still sitting in the persistence context with a null
            //      id. Hibernate asserts: "Entry for instance of User has a null
            //      identifier (this can happen if the session is flushed after an
            //      exception occurs)". The real error is then buried under an
            //      assertion failure from the framework's own internals.
            //
            // Which is Day-03's lesson arriving on schedule: catching an
            // exception in Java does not undo it in the database, and the
            // persistence context is unusable afterwards too. Read the exception
            // that was thrown; do not ask the dead transaction a question.
