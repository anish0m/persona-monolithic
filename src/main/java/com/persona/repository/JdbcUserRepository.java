/**
 * Stores users in PostgreSQL.
 *
 * <p><b>The class Day-01 promised.</b> The in-memory repository's javadoc said
 * that when the store was swapped, "the service and controller should not need a
 * single edit — if they do, the boundary was drawn in the wrong place". This is
 * the test of that claim, and it very nearly passed: the only change required
 * above this package was {@code UserService} naming {@link UserRepository}
 * instead of the concrete in-memory class. No method signature moved, no logic
 * changed, the controller was not opened. That is what the layering was for.
 *
 * <p><b>Why no JPA.</b> Day-04 adds Hibernate, and it will save real work. But an
 * ORM that generates SQL you have never written is a tool you cannot debug: when
 * it emits 400 queries for one page, you need to know what it should have emitted.
 * So today the SQL is visible, typed out, and boring on purpose.
 *
 * <p>{@link JdbcClient} is Spring's modern fluent wrapper over JDBC. Compared to
 * raw {@code java.sql}, it closes connections, handles the {@code PreparedStatement},
 * and converts checked {@link SQLException}s — none of which is the interesting
 * part. The interesting part is that every query here is parameterised.

     * both writes the row and reports the generated id. The alternative —
     * {@code INSERT} then {@code SELECT} to find out what id was assigned — is two
     * round trips and needs a way to identify the row it just created, which is

     * looked theoretical on Day-01, load-bearing from this line onward.
