/**
 * What persona sends back when asked about a user.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not return the {@code User}?</b> Because Jackson serialises a User by
 * calling its getters — and {@code getPassword()} is a getter. The response would
 * contain the password, for every user, on every read endpoint.
 *
 * <p>It is worth being precise about why the existing protection does not help
 * here. {@code User.toString()} deliberately omits the password, and there is a
 * test asserting that. <b>Jackson never calls {@code toString()}.</b> That test
 * protects log files. It does nothing whatsoever for the wire.
 *
 * <p>So the password is excluded the only way that actually holds: it is not a
 * field of this record. The difference is between "my API happens not to expose
 * the password" and "my API <em>cannot</em> expose the password". Only the second
 * survives someone editing {@code User} next month.
 *
 * <p>{@code username} is included even though it is not a stored field — it is
 * derived by {@link User#getUsername()}. A DTO is shaped by what the client needs,
 * not by what the table holds; the two are allowed to differ, and this is the
 * first place they do.
 *
 * <p>{@code image} is a plain nullable String here rather than an
 * {@code Optional}: an absent value serialises to JSON {@code null}, which is
 * exactly how JSON already says "absent". Optional is for Java callers who might
 * forget to check. JSON has no such problem.

     * {@code User} must not know that a web layer exists. The arrows point one
