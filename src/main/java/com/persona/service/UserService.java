/**
 * Business rules for the user domain.
 *
 * <p>This class is the first one in the project that exists purely because of
 * layering. The model validates itself, the repository stores things, and between
 * signing up and being stored there is a set of decisions belonging to neither:
 * whether this signup is allowed at all. That is what lives here.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class must never learn.</b> No {@code HttpServletRequest}, no
 * status codes, no JSON, no {@code @RequestMapping}. If HTTP disappeared tomorrow
 * and persona were driven from a command line or a scheduled import, every method
 * below would still be correct and still be called. That is the test for whether
 * a rule belongs here rather than in the controller — not importance, but whether
 * it survives the transport being replaced.
 *
 * <p>It also does not know <em>where</em> users are stored. It holds an
 * {@code InMemoryUserRepository} today and a PostgreSQL-backed one from Day-03,
 * and the intent is that this file does not change when that happens.

     * <p>The duplicate check below looks redundant — {@code InMemoryUserRepository}
     * already throws on a taken key. It is not redundant, but nor is it what makes
     * the system correct, and the distinction matters:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>This check is policy.</b> It decides that a taken email means
     *       rejection, and it exists so the caller gets a clean, deliberate error
     *       instead of whatever the storage layer happens to throw. Policy can
     *       change — a later persona might allow reusing the email of a
     *       soft-deleted account — and when it does, it changes here.</li>
     *   <li><b>The storage constraint is the guarantee.</b> Both this check and the
     *       repository's are look-then-act, and both lose the same race: two
     *       threads read "free" before either writes. Moving the check between
     *       layers does not make it atomic. From Day-03 the real guarantee is a
     *       {@code UNIQUE} constraint in PostgreSQL, which cannot be raced because
     *       the database serialises it.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Which is the rule to carry forward: <b>never let the only copy of a
     * correctness guarantee live in application code.</b> Application code races.
     * Constraints do not. The check here buys a good error message, not safety.
     *
     * <h2>Day-05 — why the parameter is a DTO and not a User</h2>
     *
     * <p>This signature used to be {@code register(User)}, and the controller
     * built the {@code User}. The change is not a tidy-up; it removes a question
     * that had no reliable answer.
     *
     * <p>{@code register(User)} cannot distinguish a {@code User} assembled from
     * an untrusted request body from one Hibernate just loaded out of the
     * database. The first carries a plaintext password that <b>must</b> be
     * hashed; the second carries a hash that <b>must not</b> be hashed again —
     * doing so locks the account permanently, silently, with no error anywhere.
     * The type cannot say which it is holding, so a human has to remember, and
     * that is the bug.
     *
     * <p>A {@link CreateUserRequest} is only ever constructed from a request
     * body, so its password is only ever plaintext. The question stops being
     * askable rather than being answered carefully. <b>A type is a cheaper
     * guarantee than a check.</b>
     *
     * <h2>Why the hashing is here and nowhere else</h2>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Not in the controller.</b> Hashing is not a transport concern.
     *       Put it there and the Day-09 admin import, and anything else that is
     *       not an HTTP request, silently stores plaintext.</li>
     *   <li><b>Not in {@code User}.</b> The model would need a
     *       {@code PasswordEncoder}, and a domain class holding a Spring bean
     *       can no longer be built in a plain unit test.</li>
     *   <li><b>Here</b>, because this is the one method that knows a signup is
     *       happening — which is exactly when a plaintext password exists and is
     *       the last moment it may.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Note the ordering below is load-bearing: the plaintext is encoded
     * <em>before</em> the {@code User} is constructed, so no {@code User} object
     * ever holds a plaintext password, not even transiently. Had the {@code User}
     * been built first and the field set afterwards, there would be a window in
     * which a plaintext password is one {@code toString} or one exception away
     * from a log file.

    /**
     * Edits the mutable parts of a profile. <b>Day-05.</b>
     *
     * <p>{@link UpdateProfileRequest} carries three fields and cannot express a
     * change to the email, the password or the id. That is the defence: not a
     * check that those fields are absent, but a type in which they do not exist.
     * See that record for why each exclusion is not negotiable.
     *
     * <h2>Why there is no save() call</h2>
     *
     * <p>Under the JPA repository this method is running inside a transaction, so
     * the {@code User} returned by {@code getByEmail} is <b>managed</b>: it lives
     * in the persistence context, Hibernate holds a snapshot of it, and at commit
     * it compares the object to that snapshot and writes an UPDATE for whatever
     * differs. The setter <em>is</em> the write. Day-04 proved this with a test
     * that mutated a field, called no {@code save}, and then read the row back
     * with raw SQL.
     *
     * <p>Calling {@code save} anyway would not be wrong, merely redundant — and
     * it would teach the wrong model of what is happening.
     *
     * <p><b>{@code @Transactional} is what makes any of that true.</b> Without it
     * there is no persistence context spanning the method, the setters run
     * against a detached object, and nothing is written — <em>silently</em>, with
     * a green test if the test asserts on the returned object rather than on the
     * database. That is the fifth appearance of this project's recurring failure
     * mode, and the reason {@code UserServiceIT} reads the row back with
     * {@code JdbcClient} rather than asking Hibernate.
     *
     * <p>Note the annotation is <b>not</b> conditional on which repository is
     * active. Under the JDBC implementation it is harmless: the repository's own
     * write is a single statement and already atomic. Correct under both, which
     * is the property that has kept this class unchanged since Day-01.
     *
     * <h2>What is quietly working here</h2>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code getByEmail} throws rather than returning {@code Optional},
     *       because absence <em>is</em> an error for an update even though it is
     *       not for a lookup. Slice 4's rule.</li>
     *   <li>{@code setFirstName} still runs {@code requireText}, so even with the
     *       DTO's {@code @NotBlank} removed the object refuses the invalid
     *       state.</li>
     *   <li>{@code getUsername()} needs no code at all. It is derived from the
     *       two names with no backing field, so it cannot go stale — slice 3
     *       paying out.</li>
