/**
 * Business rules for the user domain.
 *
 * <p>This class is the first one in the project that exists purely because of
 * layering. The model validates itself, the repository stores things, and between
 * signing up and being stored there is a set of decisions belonging to neither:
 * whether this signup is allowed at all. That is what lives here.
 *
 * <p><b>What this class must never learn.</b> No {@code HttpServletRequest}, no
 * status codes, no JSON, no {@code @RequestMapping}. If HTTP disappeared tomorrow
 * and persona were driven from a command line or a scheduled import, every method
 * below would still be correct and still be called. That is the test for whether
 * a rule belongs here rather than in the controller — not importance, but whether
 * it survives the transport being replaced.
 *
 * <p>It also does not know <em>where</em> users are stored. It holds an
 * {@link InMemoryUserRepository} today and a PostgreSQL-backed one from Day-03,
 * and the intent is that this file does not change when that happens.

     * requests are mid-flight, so some see the old repository and some the new,

     * <p>The duplicate check below looks redundant — {@link InMemoryUserRepository}

     * the system correct, and the distinction matters:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>This check is policy.</b> It decides that a taken email means
     *       rejection, and it exists so the caller gets a clean, deliberate error
     *       instead of whatever the storage layer happens to throw. Policy can
     *       change — a later persona might allow reusing the email of a
     *       soft-deleted account — and when it does, it changes here.</li>
     *   <li><b>The storage constraint is the guarantee.</b> Both this check and the
     *       repository's are look-then-act, and both lose the same race: two
     *       threads read "free" before either writes. Moving the check between
     *       layers does not make it atomic. From Day-03 the real guarantee is a
     *       {@code UNIQUE} constraint in PostgreSQL, which cannot be raced because
     *       the database serialises it.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Which is the rule to carry forward: <b>never let the only copy of a
     * correctness guarantee live in application code.</b> Application code races.
     * Constraints do not. The check here buys a good error message, not safety.
