/**
 * A person who can sign up and log in to persona.
 *
 * <p>Encapsulation: every field is {@code private}. Nothing outside this class
 * can reach in and change state directly. The only way in is a constructor or a
 * setter — and a setter is a method, which means it is a place where a rule can
 * later be enforced. A public field has no such place. That is the whole reason
 * for the ceremony; it is not decoration.
 *
 * <h2>Day-04 — this class is now an entity, and that cost something</h2>
 *
 * <p>Until today the class documentation opened by pointing at what was NOT
 * here: no Spring annotation, no {@code @Entity}, no SQL. The model was the one
 * layer that depended on nothing, which was exactly why every other layer was
 * allowed to depend on it. <b>That claim is no longer true</b>, and pretending
 * otherwise would be worse than the change itself.
 *
 * <p>What was actually traded:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code email} lost its {@code final}.</b> Hibernate constructs an
 *       entity empty and fills the fields by reflection, so a final field is
 *       officially unsupported — reflection can usually write one, but the JVM
 *       is free to constant-fold a value it believes fixed. "Works until the JIT
 *       optimises it" is the worst failure mode available, so this is not a risk
 *       worth carrying. See {@link #email}.</li>
 *   <li><b>A no-arg constructor exists.</b> {@code protected}, so the framework
 *       can reach it and application code cannot. See {@link #User()}.</li>
 *   <li><b>The class cannot be {@code final}</b>, nor its getters, because lazy
 *       loading hands back a generated subclass.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The honest summary: <b>JPA asks an object to weaken its design so that a
 * framework can populate it.</b> The alternative — a separate {@code UserEntity}
 * mirroring this class, mapped back and forth — keeps the model pristine and
 * costs a duplicate class plus a mapper that will drift. For an application this
 * size that trade is not worth it. On something larger, or a domain with real
 * invariants to protect, it frequently is. What matters is knowing a trade was
 * made, rather than discovering later that the model layer quietly acquired a
 * dependency on Hibernate.
 *
 * <p>What did NOT change: every validation rule, {@code getUsername()} still
 * derived, {@code equals}/{@code hashCode} still on email, {@code toString}
 * still omitting the password. JPA maps state; it has no opinion about behaviour.

    /**
     * The database's identity for this row — {@code null} until it has been saved.
     *
     * <p><b>Day-03 added this field, and the nullability is the interesting part.</b>
     * A {@code User} the controller has just built from a request is a perfectly
     * valid User that does not exist in any table yet. Only {@code save} can
     * assign an id, because only the database knows what the next one is. So the
     * type must permit "no id yet", and {@code Long} rather than {@code long} is
     * what says that — a primitive {@code long} would default to 0, and 0 is
     * indistinguishable from a real id.
     *
     * <p><b>Why equals() and hashCode() still use email, not this.</b> An obvious
     * reading of "id is the primary key" says identity should compare ids. It
     * cannot, and the reason is the null above: two unsaved users would both have
     * a null id and compare EQUAL, which would collapse them into one entry in any
     * {@code HashSet}. Worse, saving a user would change its hash code while it sat
     * in a collection — the bucket problem from Day-00, with the key moving under
     * the map.
     *
     * <p>So there are genuinely two identities here, and they are not in conflict:
     * {@code id} is what the ROW is, {@code email} is what the PERSON is. Business
     * equality is the person. This is exactly why the table has both a primary key
     * and a unique constraint.
     *
     * <p>There is no setter. Nothing in the application may assign an id — the
     * repository sets it through the package-private {@link #assignId} below, at
     * the one moment it is legitimate.
     *
     * <p><b>Day-04.</b> {@code @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)} does not
     * decide anything — it REPEATS what V1 already decided with
     * {@code GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY}. The annotation and the migration are
     * two statements of one fact, and {@code ddl-auto: validate} is what makes
     * them fail loudly at startup when they disagree.
     *
     * <p>{@code GenerationType.AUTO} is the trap here: it looks database-agnostic
     * and on PostgreSQL it silently picks {@code SEQUENCE}, which this schema does
     * not have. Never leave AUTO on when Flyway owns the DDL.
     *
     * <p>The cost of IDENTITY, worth knowing rather than acting on: Hibernate
     * cannot know the id until the INSERT has run, so it must send every INSERT
     * immediately and <b>batching is disabled for this entity</b>. A hundred
     * users is a hundred round trips. {@code SEQUENCE} fetches ids up front and
     * can batch. It does not matter for a signup table, where inserts arrive one
     * human at a time; it would matter for a high-volume append-only table.
     *
     * <p>And the nullability above is now load-bearing in a second way:
     * {@code save()} is an upsert that dispatches on this field. Null means
     * persist (INSERT), non-null means merge (UPDATE). A primitive {@code long}
     * would make every new object look like an update of row 0.

     *
     * <p>Letting the database stamp this rather than the application is deliberate.
     * Application servers drift, run in different timezones, and there may be
     * several of them; the database is one clock. For a record of when something
     * happened, one slightly-wrong clock beats several disagreeing ones.
     *
     * <p><b>Day-04 — {@code updatable = false} is "no setter", enforced a second
     * time.</b> This field already had no setter, so application code could not
     * overwrite what the database stamped. That is no longer sufficient on its
     * own: dirty checking compares a managed entity against its load-time
     * snapshot and writes anything that differs, without anyone calling
     * {@code save()}. {@code updatable = false} removes the column from every
     * generated UPDATE permanently. Ownership stated in Java AND in the mapping.
     *
     * <p><b>{@code insertable = false} is the half that was missed first, and the
     * failure is worth keeping.</b> With only {@code nullable = false} the first
     * INSERT failed:
     *
     * <pre>
     * org.hibernate.PropertyValueException: not-null property references a null
     * or transient value for entity com.persona.model.User.createdAt
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>V1 says {@code created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()} — the
     * DATABASE supplies this value. But {@code nullable = false} made Hibernate
     * check the field in Java BEFORE sending the statement, and a freshly
     * constructed User has no timestamp yet, so it refused. The default never got
     * the chance to apply. {@link com.persona.repository.JdbcUserRepository} never
     * hit this because its hand-written INSERT simply does not name the column.
     *
     * <p>{@code insertable = false} says "omit this column from INSERT entirely",
     * which is precisely what lets {@code DEFAULT now()} do its job. The pair
     * together — neither inserted nor updated — is the mapping for <b>a value this
     * application reads and never writes.</b>
     *
     * <p>The general shape, and it is the recurring one: <b>an annotation is a
     * claim about the schema, and two correct-looking claims can still describe a
     * column nobody is allowed to write.</b> The Java-side check and the SQL-side
     * default were each individually right and jointly wrong.
     *
     * <p>Consequence, deliberately accepted: after {@code save()} the in-memory
     * object's {@code createdAt} is whatever it was before — Hibernate did not
     * send the column, so it does not know what the database chose. Reading it
     * back requires a refresh, which {@link com.persona.repository.JpaUserRepository#save}

     * <p><b>Day-04 — this field WAS {@code final}, and JPA took that away.</b>
