     * A {@code User} the controller has just built from a request is a perfectly
     * valid User that does not exist in any table yet. Only {@code save} can
     * assign an id, because only the database knows what the next one is. So the

     * what says that — a primitive {@code long} would default to 0, and 0 is
     * indistinguishable from a real id.
     *
     * <p><b>Why equals() and hashCode() still use email, not this.</b> An obvious
     * reading of "id is the primary key" says identity should compare ids. It
     * cannot, and the reason is the null above: two unsaved users would both have
     * a null id and compare EQUAL, which would collapse them into one entry in any
     * {@code HashSet}. Worse, saving a user would change its hash code while it sat
     * in a collection — the bucket problem from Day-00, with the key moving under
     * the map.
     *
     * <p>So there are genuinely two identities here, and they are not in conflict:
     * {@code id} is what the ROW is, {@code email} is what the PERSON is. Business
     * equality is the person. This is exactly why the table has both a primary key
     * and a unique constraint.
     *
     * <p>There is no setter. Nothing in the application may assign an id — the
     * repository sets it through the package-private {@link #assignId} below, at

     * available to everyone forever, so a controller could invent an id, and an
     * invented id is a row pointing at the wrong person. Passing identity through
     * a constructor means it can only be supplied at the one moment it is known,

     * {@code email}: rather than documenting that something must not happen,
     * arrange for there to be no method with which to do it.

     * <p>Validation still runs. It is tempting to skip it — the row was validated
     * on the way in, so this is wasted work. But "was validated on the way in" is
     * an assumption about every past version of this application and about anyone
     * who has ever held a psql prompt. If the database contains a user with a blank
     * name, the useful moment to find out is on read, not three layers later.
