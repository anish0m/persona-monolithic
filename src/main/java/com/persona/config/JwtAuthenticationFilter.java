/**
 * Reads {@code Authorization: Bearer <token>}, verifies it, and tells Spring
 * Security who is calling. <b>Day-06.</b>
 *
 * <p>This is the piece that makes a stateless token behave like a session.
 * Every request arrives anonymous; this filter runs before the controller,
 * and if the token checks out it populates the {@code SecurityContext} for
 * the duration of that one request. Nothing is remembered afterwards — which
 * is the whole claim of "stateless", and why there is no session store
 * anywhere in this project.
 *
 * <h2>Why OncePerRequestFilter</h2>
 *
 * <p>A plain {@code Filter} can run more than once for a single HTTP request
 * — a {@code forward} to an error page, or an async dispatch, re-enters the
 * chain. Doing the work twice is wasteful here and genuinely wrong in filters
 * that mutate state. {@link OncePerRequestFilter} guarantees exactly one
 * invocation per request, which is what almost every custom filter actually
 * wants.
 *
 * <h2>What this filter deliberately does NOT do</h2>
 *
 * <p>It never rejects anything. A missing header, a garbage token, an expired
 * one — all leave the {@code SecurityContext} empty and call
 * {@code chain.doFilter} anyway. Deciding that an empty context is not good
 * enough for a particular URL is the job of the authorization rules in
 * {@link SecurityConfig}, and keeping the two separate is what lets
 * {@code POST /users} and {@code POST /auth/login} stay public without this
 * filter needing to know they exist.

        // returned 401 instead of 403 — a valid token behaving like no token.
