/**
 * Tokens that have been logged out but have not yet expired. <b>Day-06.</b>
 *
 * <h2>Why this class has to exist at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>A JWT is valid because its signature verifies and its {@code exp} has
 * not passed — both facts are carried <em>inside the token</em>. There is no
 * server-side record of it, which is the whole point of statelessness and is
 * exactly what makes logout hard: deleting something that was never stored is
 * not possible. Without this class, {@code POST /auth/logout} could return
 * 200 while the token it "revoked" kept working until it expired. <b>An
 * endpoint that lies about what it did is worse than one that does not
 * exist.</b>
 *
 * <p>So logout is implemented as the only thing that actually works:
 * remembering which tokens are no longer accepted, and checking that list on
 * every request. Note what this costs — it reintroduces server-side state,
 * the precise thing the JWT was chosen to avoid. That is not a flaw in the
 * implementation; it is the real trade-off, and any design that appears to
 * avoid it is either not really revoking or is shortening {@code exp} until
 * the window is small enough to ignore.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately wrong with this implementation</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is an in-memory map, so it is lost on restart (every logged-out token
 * becomes valid again) and it is per-instance (a second application instance
 * does not know about it). Both are acceptable here and neither would be in
 * production, where this belongs in Redis — one shared store, with per-key
 * expiry doing the eviction below for free. Recorded as dated debt rather
 * than hidden: the correct shape is the same, only the storage differs.

     * <p>Storing the expiry — rather than just the token — is what keeps this
     * map from growing forever. A denied token only needs to be remembered
     * until its own {@code exp} passes, because after that the signature check
     * rejects it regardless. Without the eviction below, a long-running
     * server accumulates every token ever logged out, and a map that only
     * grows is a memory leak with extra steps.
     *
     * <p>{@link ConcurrentHashMap} rather than a plain {@code HashMap}: this
     * bean is a singleton shared by every concurrent request, and a plain
     * HashMap resized by two threads at once can corrupt into an infinite
     * loop on read. Same reasoning as {@code UserService}'s fields being
     * final — a shared object needs to be safe for the sharing it will get.
