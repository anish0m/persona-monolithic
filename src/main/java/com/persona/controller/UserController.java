/**

 *
 * <p>Everything in this file is <b>translation</b>. HTTP comes in, a method call
 * goes down, a Java value comes back, a status code goes out. There is not one
 * business decision here, and that is the property to protect — the moment an
 * {@code if} about what is <em>allowed</em> appears in this class, the rule it
 * encodes stops applying to anything that is not an HTTP request.
 *
 * <p>{@code @RestController} is {@code @Controller} + {@code @ResponseBody}: it
 * makes "the return value IS the response body, serialise it" the default for
 * every method, instead of "the return value is the name of a template to
 * render". persona will eventually have both — Day-09 adds a plain
 * {@code @Controller} serving the Bootstrap pages, alongside this one serving
 * JSON.
 *
 * <p>{@code @RequestMapping("/users")} factors the shared prefix out of the four
 * methods below. Note the noun, and note the plural: {@code /users} is the
 * collection, {@code /users/{email}} is one member of it. No verb appears in any
 * path in this file — the verb is the HTTP method, which is the one part of the
 * request every proxy, cache and load balancer between here and the client
 * actually reads.

    //
    //      "Option 2 today, because there is exactly one controller and
    //       moving to option 3 is then a genuine, visible improvement
    //       rather than architecture applied in advance."
    //
    //  This is that move. See GlobalExceptionHandler.
    //
    //  What made it genuine rather than speculative: Day-05 added
    //  MethodArgumentNotValidException, which is a FRAMEWORK exception with
    //  one correct response everywhere. Handling that per-controller is
    //  already duplication at N=1 — the second controller would not
    //  introduce the problem, it would only make it visible.
    //
    //  Worth knowing for later: a handler declared inside a controller WINS
    //  over the same handler in the advice. That is useful as a deliberate
    //  override and confusing as an accident, which is why this class now
    //  has none at all rather than a subset.
