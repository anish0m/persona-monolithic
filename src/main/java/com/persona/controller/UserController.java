/**

 * goes down, a Java value comes back, a status code goes out. There is not one
 * business decision here, and that is the property to protect — the moment an
 * {@code if} about what is <em>allowed</em> appears in this class, the rule it
 * encodes stops applying to anything that is not an HTTP request.
 *
 * <p>{@code @RestController} is {@code @Controller} + {@code @ResponseBody}: it
 * makes "the return value IS the response body, serialise it" the default for
 * every method, instead of "the return value is the name of a template to
 * render". persona will eventually have both — Day-09 adds a plain
 * {@code @Controller} serving the Bootstrap pages, alongside this one serving
 * JSON.
 *
 * <p>{@code @RequestMapping("/users")} factors the shared prefix out of the four
 * methods below. Note the noun, and note the plural: {@code /users} is the
 * collection, {@code /users/{email}} is one member of it. No verb appears in any
 * path in this file — the verb is the HTTP method, which is the one part of the
 * request every proxy, cache and load balancer between here and the client
 * actually reads.

    //  These methods are a routing table: exception type in, status code
    //  out. Spring catches anything thrown below this class and dispatches
    //  on the TYPE.
    //
    //  Which is only possible because Day-01 built real exception classes.

    //  would be nothing to dispatch on but the English text — and you
    //  cannot route on a sentence.

    //  Three places this translation could live:
    //    1. try/catch in every method            -> N copies of the rule
    //    2. @ExceptionHandler here               -> one copy, this controller
    //    3. @RestControllerAdvice, app-wide      -> Day-09
    //
    //  Option 2 today, because there is exactly one controller and moving to
    //  option 3 is then a genuine, visible improvement rather than
    //  architecture applied in advance.
