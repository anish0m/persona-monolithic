/**
 * One routing table from exception type to HTTP status, for every controller.
 *
 * <h2>Why these moved out of UserController</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three of these handlers lived inside {@link UserController} from Day-02,
 * and that was the right call at the time: there was one controller, and
 * locality beats indirection. The Day-02 comment said the move to a global
 * advice should happen when it became "a genuine, visible improvement rather
 * than architecture applied in advance".
 *
 * <p>Day-05 made it genuine. {@link MethodArgumentNotValidException} is a
 * <b>framework</b> exception with exactly one correct response everywhere in the
 * application. Handling that per-controller is duplication at N=1 — a second
 * controller would not create the problem, only make it obvious.
 *
 * <p>{@code @RestControllerAdvice} is {@code @ControllerAdvice} +
 * {@code @ResponseBody}: a registry of {@code @ExceptionHandler} methods that
 * applies to every controller in the application. Spring catches anything
 * thrown below the web layer and dispatches on the exception <b>type</b>.
 *
 * <p>Which is only possible because Day-01 built real exception classes. Had
 * the service thrown {@code new RuntimeException("email taken")}, there would be
 * nothing to dispatch on but English text, and you cannot route on a sentence.
 *
 * <h2>A 500 is a confession</h2>
 *
 * <p>4xx means the caller did something wrong and can fix it. 5xx means the
 * server did, and only the server can. <b>Every unhandled exception becomes a
 * 500</b>, so an incomplete list here does not merely produce a wrong number: it
 * misattributes blame, and buries real defects among false ones. On Day-19
 * somebody is paged on a 500 rate, and validation errors inside that number make
 * the signal useless.
 *
 * <p>So this class is best understood not as error handling but as a
 * <b>classification of blame</b>, whose default answer is "my fault".
 *
 * <h2>Why ProblemDetail</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ProblemDetail} is Spring's implementation of RFC 9457, the standard
 * shape for an HTTP error body. It is built in, so there is no dependency and no
 * hand-maintained {@code ErrorResponse} class to drift.
 *
 * <p>Being standardised, clients and gateways understand it without reading any
 * documentation — which matters on Day-17, when an API Gateway sits in front of
 * five services and five hand-rolled error shapes would mean five parsers.
 *
 * <h2>What an error must never contain</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   GOOD  "Email khi0ne&#64;example.com is already registered"
 *   BAD   "duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"users_email_key\""
 *   BAD   the stack trace, the SQL, or the hash
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The second leaks the schema, the table names and the constraint names to
 * anyone who can POST twice. <b>Log the cause, return the meaning</b> — they are
 * different audiences, one authenticated by having server access and the other
 * being the internet. Day-02 stopped the password leaving through the DTO; an
 * exception message is the other door out, and it bypasses the DTO entirely.

    /**
     * 400 — bean validation rejected the request body.
     *
     * <p>This is the handler Day-05 exists for, and the reason it is not a
     * one-liner is that {@code @Valid} collects <b>every</b> violation before
     * failing. Six bad fields arrive as one exception carrying six failures:
     *
     * <pre>
     * MethodArgumentNotValidException
     *   +- BindingResult
     *        +- FieldError  field: "firstName"  message: "First name is required"
     *        +- FieldError  field: "email"      message: "must be a valid email address"
     *        +- FieldError  field: "password"   message: "must be between 8 and 72 characters"
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>A handler that returned a status and a single message string would have
     * collected six answers and thrown away five. So the structure is preserved
     * rather than flattened, and the response carries a field-to-message map:
     *
     * <pre>
     * { "status": 400,
     *   "title":  "Bad Request",
     *   "detail": "Request validation failed",
     *   "errors": { "firstName": "First name is required",
     *               "email":     "must be a valid email address" } }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>A form can highlight three fields from a map. It can only print a
     * sentence. <b>An error is data</b>; the moment it is concatenated into
     * prose, every consumer has to parse English back out of it — which is the
     * same reason {@code DuplicateEmailException} was given a {@code getEmail()}
     * accessor in slice 4 rather than only a message.
     *
     * <p>A {@code LinkedHashMap} rather than {@code Map.of} for two reasons that
     * both matter: insertion order is preserved, so the response lists fields in
     * declaration order rather than a hash order that changes between runs; and
     * {@code Map.of} throws on a duplicate key, which happens the moment one
     * field carries two failing constraints — {@code @NotBlank} and
     * {@code @Size} on the same field is not hypothetical, it is what
     * {@code password} has. The merge function below keeps the first message
     * rather than letting the handler itself throw while reporting an error.
