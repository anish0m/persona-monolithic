/**
 * The SQL, executed against a real PostgreSQL.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this file has to exist.</b> Every other test in this project uses the
 * in-memory repository, which means not one of them executes a single line of
 * {@link JdbcUserRepository}. A typo in a column name, a wrong placeholder count,
 * a mapping that reads {@code first_name} into {@code lastName} — all of it would
 * sail through a fully green suite and fail on the first real request.
 *
 * <p>That is the Day-02 lesson generalised: <em>a green test that does not execute
 * the thing it is named after proves nothing.</em> Mocks test the code you wrote
 * around the database. Only a database tests the SQL.
 *
 * <p><b>IT, not Test.</b> The name matters mechanically: Maven's Surefire plugin
 * runs {@code *Test} during {@code mvn test}, so an ordinary build stays fast and
 * needs nothing installed. This class is also guarded by
 * {@code @EnabledIfSystemProperty}, so it is skipped unless explicitly asked for:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     docker compose up -d persona-monolith-db
 *     mvn test -Dit=true
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Day-19 replaces the guard with Testcontainers, which starts a throwaway
 * Postgres from inside the test itself — no manual step and no shared state. It is
 * deliberately not used today: it would add a library and a concept on a day that
 * already has Flyway, JDBC and SQL in it.

/*
 * DAY-04 CHANGE — two profiles now, where one used to be enough.
 *
 * This said @ActiveProfiles("jdbc-it") while JdbcUserRepository was
 * @Profile("!test"): the bean matched because "jdbc-it" is not "test", which was
 * true by accident rather than by intent. Now that the implementation names
 * itself positively as "jdbc", the profile that SELECTS the bean and the profile
 * that CONFIGURES the datasource are two different things and both must be named.
 *
 *     jdbc     -> selects JdbcUserRepository          (the bean)
 *     jdbc-it  -> loads application-jdbc-it.properties (the database)
 *
 * The old form worked as long as nobody looked at it. That is the recurring
 * hazard of negations: they are satisfied by everything that has not been
 * invented yet.
