/**
 * {@link JpaUserRepository} against a real PostgreSQL database. <b>Day-04.</b>
 *
 * <p>The deliberate twin of {@link JdbcUserRepositoryIT}: same database, same
 * Flyway migrations, same assertions about behaviour. Two implementations proved
 * interchangeable by being subjected to the same questions — which is what the
 * {@link UserRepository} interface claimed and what nothing had yet checked.
 *
 * <p><b>The most valuable assertion in this file is the one nobody wrote.</b>
 * With {@code ddl-auto: validate}, this context cannot start unless every
 * {@code @Column} claim on {@link User} is true of the real table: every name,
 * every length, every nullability. A wrong {@code length = 100} or a mistyped
 * column fails the whole suite at startup, naming the column. The test method
 * bodies test behaviour; the ACT OF STARTING tests the mapping.
 *
 * <p>That is why {@code create-drop} would be worse than useless here. It would
 * build the schema from the entities, so the entities would trivially match it
 * and V1 would never be consulted — a green suite proving nothing about what
 * ships. Same failure shape as Day-01's test that registered once and asserted
 * a duplicate was rejected.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Transactional} rolls each test back, as in the JDBC suite. One
 * addition worth naming: the rollback now also discards the PERSISTENCE CONTEXT,
 * so entities cannot leak between tests. It also means everything here runs
 * inside one transaction, which is exactly why {@link #findByEmailTwiceReturnsTheSameObject}
 * can demonstrate the first-level cache at all.

     * than ask the dead transaction a question.

     * <p><b>Why there is no {@code count()} assertion here</b> — the same reason
     * as the JDBC suite: it would be refused with SQL state 25P02. The constraint
     * is what guarantees the second row did not land; the exception is the proof
     * it fired.
